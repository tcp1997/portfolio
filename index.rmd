# Hello, my name is Tyler Padua.

I am a senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, that is studying Geographic Information Science. I want to demonstrate my knowledge of GIS through data acquisition, manipulation, analysis, and programming by showcasing some of the work I've done as an undergraduate. I am aspiring to earn a career in GIS or data analysis.
