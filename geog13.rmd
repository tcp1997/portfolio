As a Geographic Information Systems major, I had to learn how to use a variety of programs which includes Python, ArcGIS, and RStudio. Here is a collection of my work. Click on the links to view more details.


## [My First Map](https://tcp1997.github.io/)

- Used a CSV file containing the name, description, latitude, longitude, and picture URL to create a map of several of my favorite places
- Used Github to create a website page for the map
- Practiced basic HTML writing to create website

## [Developing a Project Website](https://github.com/tcp1997)

- For this assignment I built a static users site with Github Pages
- I have included my Github repository for access to all the code
- I want to showcase my ability to be an independent learner and problem solver by developing this website on my own

## [Transportation Planning & Modelling Synthesis Report](FinalLab.pdf)

- Cumulative report of fundamental Rstudio concepts learned throughout the course
- Took large datasets, cleaned them, summarize information, and aggregate information
- Visualized dataset using maps, bar graphs, and histograms

## [Developing a Task Manager Using Python](cs8_final.pdf)

- Here is the interactive main menu portion of a three part project consisting of multiple validation functions and task functions
- Developed using Python programming fundamentals like string concatenation, tuples, lists, dictionaries, for loops, and while loops
- Example of helper functions include is_numeric, a function that returns TRUE if the string 'val' contains a valid integer or a float. Otherwise, returns FALSE
